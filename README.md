To run the project:
1. Start servers in XAMPP (or manager-osx for MacOS)
2. Populate database with the provided MySqlSetup.sql file in phpmyadmin
3. Run Server.java (make sure Server is running first, or the next step won't work)
4. Run Main.java 

Notes
1. /BusinessObjects/Main was the first interface we started working on
2. We moved on to Client & Server, Client being the interface 
3. Lastly, we made a GUI (in Main) for the original console interface 
4. The old interfaces were kept for reference purposes
