To run the project:
1. Start servers in XAMPP (or manager-osx for MacOS)
2. Populate database with the provided MySqlSetup.sql file in phpmyadmin
3. Run Server.java (make sure Server is running first, or the next step won't work)
4. Run /GUI/Main 

Notes
1. /BusinessObjects/Main was the first interface we started working on
2. We moved on to Client & Server, Client being the interface 
3. Lastly, we made a GUI for the original console interface, in /GUI/Main 
4. The old interfaces were kept for reference purposes
